Event Attendance and QR Code Check-In:

Generate QR codes for event tickets.
Check-in participants by scanning QR codes using a mobile device.
Notifications and Reminders:

Email and SMS notifications for event reminders, updates, and announcements.
Real-time notifications using Laravel Echo and WebSockets.
API for Mobile App Integration:

RESTful API endpoints for managing events and user interactions.
Secure API with authentication tokens using Laravel Passport or Sanctum.
Reports and Analytics:

Generate reports on event attendance, registrations, and user activity.
Visualize data using charts and graphs.
Payment Integration:

Integrate payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) for paid events.
Handle payment transactions and refunds.
Technical Requirements:
